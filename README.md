## Welcome to Vintage Cars!

## What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?

Ever since automotives were invented, cars were evolving very fast and more environmentally friendly. But there are old cars that, though time already passes, are still as good as the modern ones. Itâ€™s good to point out that the world is accumulating a lot of garbage that, instead of scrapping the old unused cars, it should be integrated into circulation again but lessen their emission of contaminant gas.

So with this project, I want to showcase the simplicity but elegant style of these cars and to promote the circulation of these cars with the help of modern technology.
