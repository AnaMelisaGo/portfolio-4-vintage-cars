## Welcome to Vintage Cars!

## What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?

Ever since automotives were invented, they were evolving very fast and even more environmentally friendly. But there are old cars that, though time already passes, are still as good as the modern ones. It’s good to point out that the world is accumulating a lot of garbage and, instead of scrapping the old unused cars, it should be integrated into circulation again but lessen their emission of contaminant gas.

With this project, I want to showcase the simplicity but elegant style of these cars and to be able to reuse these cars for different purposes and to promote them back into circulation with the help of modern technology. It's also a good opportunity for owners to gain cash by sharing their properties to avid fans of classic and vintage cars.

This project is to show how easy and fast a single framework can build a real-life website with complete functionality and libraries to choose from. Django is an open-source web framework that provides an easy and efficient way to create websites with minimum hassles. It comes with resources that are required by developers, specially those who are just starting their journey in Software Development.


### Favicon
I opted to use an image of a very well known classic car as the favicon of my project.

### Functionality of Project

There are different functionalities that are implemented in this project. One of them is to be able to register, to log in the registered username and to log out.

Any users, general users and registered users can view and read any post created. Those posts are created only by registered users. It can also be updated or deleted only by the author.

The Events section is integrated to the web page where anyone can browse to different upcoming events. Only admin staff can create, update and delete these posts. The rest of users can only read the content.
A contact page is available for anyone who wants to rent a car or has any enquiry regarding a car, a post or the webpage.
